        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Bob Marley is a legendary figure in music history, best known for popularizing reggae music and promoting principles of social justice, love, and peace. He was born Robert Nesta Marley on February 6, 1945, in Nine Mile, Jamaica. Marley was raised in poverty by a single mother, and although he had hardships in his early years, his unwavering spirit and love of music helped him achieve success. </p>
        <p>When Marley, together with his boyhood mates Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston, created The Wailers in the late 1950s, his musical career really got underway. They started off playing ska and rocksteady before switching to reggae, which ended up becoming their hallmark sound. Due to the combination of his moving lyrics and deep voice, Marley became known as a musical visionary and found a global following.</p>
        <p>Bob Marley and The Wailers soared to international prominence in the 1970s with albums like "Catch a Fire," "Burnin'," and "Exodus," which included classic songs like "No Woman, No Cry," "Redemption Song," and "One Love." Not only did Marley's music provide entertainment, but it also acted as a potent activist instrument, supporting the rights of the underprivileged and downtrodden. </p>
        <p>Beyond his creative output, Marley's devotion to harmony and peace was evident in his private life. His One Love concept and Rastafarian beliefs influenced millions of people throughout the world, bridging cultural and geographic divides. Up until his tragic death from illness on May 11, 1981, at the age of 36, Marley persevered in spreading his message of love and equality in the face of many obstacles, including an attempted murder in 1976.</p>
        <p>Bob Marley's presence is still felt decades after his death, having influenced a new generation of artists and campaigners.
